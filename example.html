	If you leave fries on your plate you are a horrible person. The
little scraps of lettuce in the bottom of a SubWay wrapper. That’s
not a damnable offense. A pickle left on your plate. Worse, the
people who leave entire portions of their meal on the plate and then
throw it away as if they didn’t just trash a perfectly good
sandwich? You bought the meal, eat it! To make it worse, society
thinks it’s unacceptable for people who actually want to eat what
you have left as trash.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; line-height: 150%">
	Last week I was at Wendy’s just trying to enjoy my fries and
frosty when the girl in the next booth, who was trying to look hot
but was really making everyone else in the restaurant want to barf,
gets up and just leaves. Flat out picks up her little over-sparkled
makeup bag and struts toward the nearest glowing red “EXIT” sign.
Well, that took her straight past me. Me and my frosty fries. Her
with her Big Bacon Cheddar Cheeseburger and half a box of fresh and
piping nuggies. Well, as this chick slides by I humbly petition,</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; line-height: 150%">
	“Hey, are you going home?”</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; line-height: 150%">
	“Why?”</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; line-height: 150%">
	“I was just wondering if you were going to eat that.”</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; line-height: 150%">
	“I’m going to eat <i>you</i>.”</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; line-height: 150%">
	Then—the audacity—she makes a bee-line back to her booth, opens
the top of that delicious conglomerate of cheesy bacon goodness and
spits, smearing the top bun back on. Like that’s going to stop me.
With a flip of her despicably groomed hair, she swivels without even
another word to me and stalks out the far door. As if I’m the
disgusting one!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; line-height: 150%">
	Well, my one on one date with a pocket of piping hot fries and
chilled sugar-milk lost most of its savor at this unpalatable
interaction, but I was somewhat consoled by collecting the mistreated
remains of her undeserving sandwich. Soon I recovered from the sight
of such a low human being and thoroughly enjoyed and luscious warmth
of each juicy nug and my now-topless burger. And all at the price of
a frosty and some fries fries.</p>
